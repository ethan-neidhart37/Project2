When running our implementation of the greedy knapsack algorithm, we found
that it ran much faster than the exhaustive version, never taking more than
a 1-2 seconds. When printing was turned off, it ran almost instantaneously for
all instances given. However, it did not always give the optimal solution. We
found that for instances under a size of 48, the exhaustive algorithm found
equal or better solutions. Despite this, the greedy algorithm actually performs
better than the exhaustive algorithm for sizes greater than or equal to 48,
because the exhaustive algorithm is limited to a 10 minute runtime, which is
too short to consider enough possibilities. In short, the greedy algorithm runs
much faster than the exhaustive algorithm, is less accurate for small sets, and
is more accurate for large sets.
